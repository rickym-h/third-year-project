            <p>The next step is to calculate vectors to what we call the candidate points. These are the actual
                positions of the values for perlin noise we want to generate. In some cases, it might be good to imagine
                the grid of vectors as a coordinate system, and each of our candidate points sits in between the
                coordinate grid. At each vertex of our coordinate grid there is a random normalised vector.</p>
            <p>For example our candidate point might be at (1.3, 0.4), and it is surrounded by the grid vectors at
                coordinates (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). Each of these 4 grid points have an associated random unit
                vector from the previous step, but we won't worry about these until the next step.</p>
            <p>The Candidate Point Vectors are the vectors which will point at the candidate point from each of the
                surrounding grid points. The number of these vectors needed also depends on the number of dimensions we
                are generating Perlin Noise for. For example, on a 2D plane there are 4 surrounding grid vertices
                (forming a square surrounding the point), but in 3D space there would be 8 surrounding grid vertices
                (forming a cube surrounding the point).</p>
            <p>Each of these surrounding vertices has a vector created which points towards the candidate point. Now,
                each candidate point has 4 surrounding normalised grid vectors, and 4 surrounding candidate point
                vectors (in 3D this would be 8 each, in 4D it would be 16 each, in 5D space it would be 32 each
                etc.).</p>
